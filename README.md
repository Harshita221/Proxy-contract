Proxy Contract Deployment with OpenZeppelin, Hardhat, and Alchemy


This guide will walk you through deploying a proxy contract using OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contract framework with Hardhat on the Ethereum Sepolia network. We will use Alchemy for connecting to the network.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
Node.js
npm
Hardhat
An Alchemy account and API key
An Ethereum wallet and private key (e.g., MetaMask)
An Etherscan API key for contract verification


Project Setup
1.Initialize Your Project
mkdir my-upgradeable-contract
cd my-upgradeable-contract
npm install

2.Create the .env File
Create a file named .env in the root of your project and add the following content:
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your-alchemy-api-key
PRIVATE_KEY=your-ethereum-wallet-private-key
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your-etherscan-api-key

Replace the placeholders with your actual keys.

Deployment Steps

1.Deploy the Initial Version
Run the following command to deploy the initial version of your contract:
npx hardhat run --network sepolia ./scripts/deploy_box_v1.js

After running this script, note the contract addresses from the output.

2.Verify the Contract on Etherscan
Verify the proxy contract on Etherscan with:
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia <YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>

3.Upgrade to the New Version
To upgrade to the new version of your contract, run:
npx hardhat run --network sepolia ./scripts/upgrade_box_v2.js
